# Practical JavaScript - Todo List App

These are my updates as I follow the tutorials for the todo list project in Gordon Zhu's Watch and Code Practical JavaScript course. The updates to this project start at Version 7 and build on it. I previously had each version in a separate category, but those are a lot of repositories I'm never going to edit again. This is a better approach to saving the work in GitHub.

I am uploading these files to GitHub so I can link to them in my log for 100 Days of Code.
